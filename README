SP Select Pages
===============

SP Select Pages is a variable type for Low Variables, developed by [Jamie Rumbelow](http://getsparkplugs.com) and funded by [Conflux Group](http://confluxgroup.com). It allows you to select a page from the EE Pages module and in a particular channel, and return the variable as the page URI.
